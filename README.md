# YTDL-Project
Hello Hello there.
This project is mostly for my own personal learning as it's been re written 3 times. 
But currently it works well enough to download mp3 files from yt. 

NOTE: You must install to a directory with no spaces. E.g C:\Programs\YTDLr

An update to fix some text and graphic issues is currently uploading. -Done

Planned features:

Multiple format selector

Working:

Not working:

Download to video selector

Installing to windows paths with space's does not work.
